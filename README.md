# TickTask - To-Do List App

[Visit TickTask](https://ticktask-markvayson.vercel.app/)

TickTask is a user-friendly and efficient to-do list app inspired by [Trello](https://trello.com), and was built by following the guidance of [Sonny Sangha](https://www.papareact.com/). We've taken the core concepts of Trello and added enhancements and customizations to create a tailored solution for our users' needs.

With TickTask, you can:

- **Dark Mode Quick Toggles:** Easily switch between light and dark modes to suit your preferences and reduce eye strain.
- **Add Tasks:** Quickly include tasks to your list, ensuring important deadlines and activities are never forgotten.
- **Rearrange Tasks:** Organize tasks across "To-Do," "In Progress," or "Done" categories for efficient task management.
- **Enhance Tasks:** Attach images, notes, or due dates to tasks for additional context and better planning.
